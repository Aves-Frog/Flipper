While going out I found a NFC Advertisement bar (seemingly) branded Check it out now!
I decided to check out the data I found on it, and what policies it used.

To my surprise I found that these NFC bars are not encoded to protect against overwriting, probably to enable technicians to change what ad is displayed.
This would mean that any NFC enabled device with writing capabilities would be able to display their own data or webhook.
This is obviously a security issue as this could lead to exploits and data theft.

Here's how these bars are set up to work:
Tag type: ISO 14443-3A (NXP-NTAG213)
Technology: NfcA, MifareUltralight, Ndef
Serial number: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
ATQA: 0x0044
SAK: 0x00
Memory: 180bytes over 45 pages
Data form: NFC Forum Type 2
Writable: YES
Can be made read only: Yes
Record 1: Https (web of ad)

Note that these chips could be programmed to be read only, but aren't.
Exploiters could use this functionality to take over the entire bar, more records could be made.

These NFC chips also contain a QR code which appears to be static.
