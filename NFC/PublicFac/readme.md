# NFC Chips found in public facilities
This should serve as a reminder to never read untrusted NFC chips as you wouldn't scan QR codes

## NFCWarningHttpGH
To spread awareness to the security issues I have created a NFC file that could be written onto unsecured NFC chips such as you may find on advertisements.
This specific file refers to a github page [NFCWarning.html](https://aves-frog.github.io/aves-frog/NFCWarning.html), to educate posible victims about the risks.

Uploading your own data to NFC chips may be considered vandalism or otherwise illegal depending on local regulations.
I do not recommend tempering with chips you do not have explicit permission for, I am not responsible for illegal usage of this knowledge or file.
